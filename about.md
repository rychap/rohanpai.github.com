I grew up in La Jolla, California without any knowledge of what "seasons" were until I studied abroad in Berlin in 2016.

I am currently a senior at UC Berkeley finishing my degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in May 2017. 

I am excited about novel applications of Artifical Intelligence and Machine Learning in ways that can help augment human decision making, improve lives, and, ultimately, advance the human race. I will be pursuing this passion at Apple on their Proactive Intelligence Team in Fall 2017.

I am Managing Partner of Dorm Room Fund in the Bay Area, where I invest in early stage startups run by students.

I love to ski, surf, travel, hike, scuba dive, sky dive, swim, read, and golf.
