<p>Yuval Noah Harari</p>
<p>
Sapiens is the most important book I have ever read. Sapiens aims to understand why the world is the way it is. Not because history repeats itself, but because if we understand the past we can liberate ourselves from the realities created for us and imagine the new.

Moreover, the automobile manufacturing is hidden from the consumer despite being the single most important process for making and breaking players in the space.</p>

<p>Nike Culture was my first introduction to Critical Theory — the act of taking a real world object or idea and deconstructing its history through philosophical lenses. Nike Culture has challenged me to view the philosophical nature of other objects and ideas and how they affect society.</p>

When things don't go our way, many of us get frustrated or attribute our inabilities to factors that are outside of our control. Practicing Mind is a practical introduction to “present moment awareness” and “non-judgemental observation.”</p>
